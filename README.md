# QuizSlam - Spin to Win!

This is the codebase for QuizSlam, a Kendo UI cross-platform mobile app integrated with Telerik Backend Services and Quizlet. 

To set it up, you will need to have the AppBuilder CLI installed and type `appbuilder init` to initialize the repo as an AppBuilder project.

Edits you will need to make:
- Add your Telerik Platform project API Key in views/view.js to be able to authenticate your users
- Create an account on Quizlet and edit the client_id in /views/New.js to replace the placeholder client id with your own.
